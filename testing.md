The app is about tracking where the user has been traveled and wants to travel. Kind of information center and progress tracking application.


The basic functionalities of the app works. As we can see, the menu has 4 screens and each shows different aspects of the application.
The first window shows the basic information of the US national parks. However, at the moment the API only allows me to use first 50 parks out of
all the national park in the US.
The second screen is supposed show how busy the parks are in the pie chart diagram. Due to lack of data, I could not make it as a useful pie chart,
therefore just left it as a basic example pie chart.
The third one is about google maps API that tracks the user's location and marks on the Google map API. In this way, the user will know where he/she has been.
Future improvements includes visited marker on the google maps.
The fourth is about weather that can searchable. For example, the user want to see a specific national park and choose it, then it will show specific national park's
current and 7 weeks weather. Unfortunately, I could not find a perfect WeatherAPI that supports my need. Therefore, I just displays the chicago's current and 7 weeks forecast.

That is all about my application.

Feedback: 
I used Ben's application seemed easy to use, but lacks a lot of basic functionality. As he talked to me, there is going to be 
a lot of features that need to be implemented. Otherwise, the basic functionality works just fine. It is installable on the phone
and can be uninstalled. The application provides basic information of the a US national parks. The parks are only 50 of them are showing, as Ben said 
the API allows him to use only 50 National Parks from the API.
The pie chart looks good, if it was more useful information like when it is going to be busy and so on.
The tracking location makes much more sense like where we have been and we are going to do the next destination. As Ben said it is not final yet work in progress.
The weather API is good, but apparently it only shows chicago's weather. It would be nice if we can see any chosen National Park's weather.
